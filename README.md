# Ti-Calculator
The idea is to create a scientific Ti-83 with all of the digits to have a better understanding of how it works and how itâ€™s so well programmed to have the capacity to display answers of simple to more complex questions. 
# New Changes 
I added new input to the original code by importing from math and to make sure that the code runs. I am also working on creating new rows to add more features that could be found on the TI-83.
